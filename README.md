## Usage

> Image carousel component needs to mount to two separate divs on the root html page. The first div should have the ID 'images-header' and the second div should have the ID 'image-grid'. There will be another div in-between these two to host the 'infoservice' component, but that is outside the scope of this service.

Also, the React.ref used to scroll the page down to the availability section upon clicking 'Check Prices' will look for a div outside the scope of this service with the ID 'Availability'. Make sure to communicate with team members to ensure that the Availability-Component is mounted to a div with the ID of 'Availability' for this feature to work.
